<p class="indent">In Todays Fast past world, having a website that converts the metric system into the imperial system is essential. Many jobs went online due to Covid 19, and never went back. This opened many companies to look at hiring more international employees. I will give some more examples of past mistakes due to miscalculations of imperial to metric that caused people to lose millions of dollars and even death.</p>
<li class="indent">
  In early 1999 “NASA lost its $125-million Mars Climate Orbiter because spacecraft engineers failed to convert from English to metric measurements when exchanging vital data before the craft was launched.” (NYC times)</p> </lu>
</li>
<li class="indent">
   <p> In 1996 Air Canada had a Boeing 767 jet ran out of fuel in midflight because of two mistakes in figuring the fuel supply of the airline's first aircraft to use metric measurements (NYC times)</p></li>
<li class="indent">
    Nurses use many formulas on a dau to day basis, and sometimes having a patient that has traveled from a different country that uses the opposite measuring system. For example: “In a 2013 Maryland case, for example, a two-year-old boy’s weight was entered into his electronic health record as 35 kilograms (the equivalent of 77 pounds) rather than his actual weight of 35 pounds. The mistake led to him being prescribed medication dosage designed for a person more than twice his weight. The wrong dosage led to him losing consciousness, although in this case he was fortunately readmitted back into hospital in time and was revived.” ( Chihak & Associates)</li>

<h2> History</h2>
<div class="text-box">
<ul>
<li>Metric System:</li>
<p class="indent"> The Metric system dates back to the late 18th century during the french revolution. The French National Assembly commissioned a group of scientists to develop the system. This led to the creation of the "Decimal Metric System" in 1799, which later became known as the metric system. To this day over ninety-five percent of the world uses the metric system </p>
<li>Imperial:</li>
<p class="indent">The metric system traces back to ancient civilizations, including British Empire and the roman empire.The Imperial system used in the United States today was primarily taken from the British Empire. It was widely adopted across the British colonies, including the United States. It's still only primary used in the Untied States, Liberia, Myanmar today </p>
